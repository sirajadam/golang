# Algorithms and Data structures

# What ?

This repo will mostly contain Algorithms and Data Structures written in Go

# Why ?

In my opiniong, the best way to learn a programming language is to solve a problem and then compare your solution to alternative solutions that most of the time, atleast in the beginning, are better. Even though go is one of the fastest growing language today I noticed that the alternatives were very scarce even among popular sites like LeetCode and HackerRank. Therefore, I thought it would be a good idea to share my solutions here in GitHub .
