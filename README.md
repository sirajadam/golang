# Algorithms and Data structures

# What ?

This repo will mostly contain Algorithms and Data Structures written in Go

# Why ?

In my opinion, the best way to learn a programming language is to solve problems and afterward find alternative solutions to compare. Even though the Go programming language is one of the fastest-growing languages today, I noticed that these alternative solutions were limited in quantity, even among popular sites like LeetCode and HackerRank. For this reason, I thought it would be a good idea for me to share my solutions as one of these alternatives with other aspiring go developers. Hopefully, you find this helpful.
